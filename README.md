# Resume Generator

This project is a practice project that was built in accordance with the ODIN Project CV (resume) Generator assignment to practice working with React and Vite.

[Check out the Assignment guidelines for this project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)

## Getting Started

Before getting started make sure you have the latest version of Node Package Manager (npm) installed.

If you think you will be using npm in the future for other projects, then I recommend downloading Node Version Manager (NVM) along with npm.

Then you will need to fork a copy of this repository to your Github account and then you can use the git clone command to clone your forked copy to your local environment


### NPM version issues

If you succesfully install, or are currently using npm and encounter issues, it may be due to the version of npm you are currently using.

If you encounter version-related issues then will likely need to switch to npm v22.14.0

### Setting up your local environment

Once you've cloned your forked repository to your local environment, open the root of the project and run the following command to download all dependencies:

```
npm install
```


Then run the following command to launch the local server:
```
npm run dev
````

And you can view the live server at http://localhost:5173/
